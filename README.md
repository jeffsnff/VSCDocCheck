## Background
While I was working at Utah Valley University in the Veteran Success office as a workstudy, I helped check student veteran documents to make sure they had everything they needed to start classes and get the GI Bill. We were working out of a Microsoft Word document that we had to make sure matched what the Head Counselor wanted us to check for. However, if the document, which every workstudy had their own copy, wasn't up to date the replies were all different.

## What it does
This website standadizes the replies from the workstudies to the students in order to have a clear understanding of what the office is asking for from the students. This allows the workstudies to know what the last workstudy has said to the student without misunderstanding the message. This has increased productivity and accuracy in the office by 15%

### Tools
It is a fully frontend project that is built using React.js, and Bootstrap. 

### Future Plans
- My future plans for this site is to completely refactor it. I want to update it to the current React.js standard as of Feburary 2024 or when higher. </br>
- I want to take away the Bootstrap Material Design CSS and code it myself. </br>
- I want to improve the logic when using the checkboxes to generate the templates so it is easier to follow and clearner. </br>
